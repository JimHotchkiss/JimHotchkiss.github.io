<p>I was a firefighter-paramedic for many years.  After a long, rich experience as a firefighter, I decided to move in a different direction, and so I left fire-rescue.  After leaving, I returned to school.  Since leaving fire-rescue, I have completed both a bachelor's degree (physics) and a master's degree (astronomy).  I was introduced to coding while in graduate school, and promised myself that I would return to coding, when I was out from under the pressures and demands of school.  Well, I kept that promise to myself, and after graduating, I began to further my understanding and skills of coding, all the while, tirelessly searching for a job.  Then it occurred to me: why not formally acquire this very marketable skill, while at the same time looking for employment?.  After much research and handwringing, I committed myself to Flatiron's online full-stack web-developer tack.  I'm both nervous and excited.  This is my first day!  </p>
